make it so that new modules create a popup if they need setup stuff like credentials or something

ui messages are in principle constructed like the following:

{"template": "weather", "temp": "twentyone", "city":"new york", "extra":"light rain"}

where ``template`` is the name of the html and css. if ommitted, the site will look for keys "title", and "subtitle".
if those aren't found, an error is shown

if there is a template, it'll be loaded, removed from the list, and the remaining keys will be treated as id names with the values filling the contents of those elements.

if there is no ``template`` key, the site will look for keys "title", and "subtitle".
if those aren't found, an error is shown.
if the template is found, and there is an icon key, an icon will be shown on the left hand side
if the template is found, and there is an image key, the message gets upgraded to the image container, and will use image as background
if template is found, and there is both an image and an icon key, they're matched.
