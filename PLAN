Make a modular assistant. I really mean modular.

the core has tasks, websocket networking(including handling),
a way to save user data, and a way to find new modules.


everything else is a module, and the system MUST work perfectly fine without those modules
(though modules may specify dependencies)
anime is a module
reddit is a module
website is a module
discord could be a module
handling clients is a module
